# git-a2a

Use the repository's `a2amodule.yml` and `a2amodule.lock` as durable truth. Treat
`.git-a2a/cache` as disposable. Never read dependency internals: read its published surface and
contact its declared owner for anything else.

Start with `git-a2a usage`. Use `--json` on read commands when structured output is useful.

## Consume a module

1. Run `git-a2a doctor` and inspect the current `git-a2a status -v`.
2. Add the owner's Git URL with `git-a2a add URL`; one resolved commit must drive every ecosystem.
3. Run `git-a2a sync` to opt into the managed AGENTS.md roster.
4. Inspect public knowledge with `git-a2a show ID --surface`.
5. Before committing, run `git-a2a status`, the repository tests, and review the manifest, lock,
   package-manager files, and AGENTS.md together.

After a fresh clone, run `git-a2a fetch` to reconstruct cache from the lock. Do not use `update`
just to prime cache, and never commit `.git-a2a/`.

Read [the CLI reference](references/cli.md) when choosing flags for add, set, pin, unpin, wire,
update, remove, fetch, show, or sync.

## Author a module

1. Run `git-a2a init --id ID --yes`.
2. Describe module identity, native exports, the deliberately public surface, agents, contacts,
   routing policy, consumer boundary, and release channel.
3. Validate with `git-a2a validate` and canonicalize with `git-a2a fmt --check`.
4. Export cards with `git-a2a card export AGENT` and the catalog with
   `git-a2a catalog export` when publishing discovery metadata.

Read [the authoring guide](references/authoring.md) for the workflow and
[the manifest field reference](references/manifest-reference.md) for exact values and
consequences. Do not guess an open-vocabulary token's behavior.

## Check health or change a dependency

- `git-a2a fetch`: restore cache at locked commits without changing durable state.
- `git-a2a status --offline`: verify cache, wiring, cards/trust, and roster without network.
- `git-a2a update --check`: report upstream movement; exit 1 means an update exists.
- `git-a2a update`: move the lock and every supported ecosystem together.
- `git-a2a set ID --ref REF`: deliberately change source/ref policy.
- `git-a2a pin ID` / `git-a2a unpin ID --ref REF`: freeze or resume tracking.
- `git-a2a wire ID`: repair native dependency entries from manifest and lock.

Do not hand-edit a managed AGENTS.md block. Run `git-a2a sync`, or let a successful dependency
mutation refresh an existing block.

## Contact an owner

1. Resolve the declared route with `git-a2a who ID --intent INTENT [--path FILE]`.
2. Read the owner's contact note and consumer policy.
3. With authorization for the external side effect, put a concise request in a file and run
   `git-a2a contact ID --intent INTENT --message FILE`.

`contact` may create an A2A task or GitHub Issue. URL, email, and chat kinds print instructions;
do not invent delivery or store conversation state.

## Outcomes

- Exit 0: action completed or check is clean.
- Exit 1: drift/failure was found or an operational action failed.
- Exit 2: invalid input, absent subject, unknown identity, or nothing resolved.

If a command fails, preserve the user's files and report its decisive stderr line. Mutating
commands are transactional; do not manually complete a partial-looking operation without first
checking `git diff`, `git-a2a validate`, and `git-a2a status -v`.
